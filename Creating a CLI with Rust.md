## Setup

Before getting  into our **hacker** mood,
let's create a cargo project and install the packages we'll need:

```Bash
cargo new ferris-say
```

Now, open your Cargo.toml, and add this below ``[dependencies]``:

```toml
[dependencies]
ansi_term = "0.12.1"
clap = { version = "3.1.6", features = ["derive"] }
```

Or, if you have [cargo edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) (which I prefer using), write right in your terminal:

```Bash
cargo add ansi_term 
cargo add clap --features derive
```

After it's installed, we're ready to go to the next step.

## Getting input from arguments

The crate [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) that we just installed and used in the snippet below, helps us not only to parse but to validate the an input given by the user. Let's see how to implement and use it into our application.

First thing is to create a function called ``input`` here we'll handle and parse the arguments provided; Our Cli will request only two arguments to work with: ``quote`` and ``color`` but for ``color`` we need an enum as we'll only allow to use a few types of colors (but a cool ones).

### The function signature

The function signatures let us to know how many parameters will it receive and what will be the output generated, and let's bring into scope both of the crate we'll be using along this tutorial:

```Rust
// Imports
use ansi_term::{self, Colour};
use clap::{ArgEnum, Parser};
fn input() -> (String, Colour)
```
### Parsing the input
```Rust
  #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
  #[clap(author, version, about = "cowsay rusty version")]
    struct Args {
        /// Quote that ferris will say
        #[clap(short, long)]
        quote: String,
        /// Colors to choose
        #[clap(arg_enum)]
        color: Colors,
    }
```

The ``Parser`` trait that our ``struct`` derives, parses all the arguments provided by the user and turns it into that struct fields. As you can see, we only have two fields, so it means, we'll only receive two arguments, as we state before.

Note that ``quote`` is the type of ``String`` and ``color`` is the type of ``Colors``, but it doesn't exist yet, so let's create it.

```Rust
  #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, ArgEnum, Debug)]
    enum Colors {
        // Not black because it's the background color
        Red,
        Green,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
        Purple,
        Cyan,
        White,
    }
```

Focus on that ``ArgEnum`` derived trait, that means: "Hey, this enum's variants are the only few valid types for a argument" and clap will ensure that the argument provided fits into it.

Once we have our ``Colors`` enum, let's handle each variant using the classic **match** statement.

### Handling the input

At this point we already brought into scope our ``ansi_term`` crate so it's time to use it

```Rust
// Imports
use clap::{ArgEnum, Parser};
use ansi_term::{self, Colour} // -> This one
// fn input(){...} 
```

So we can crate a match statement to filter through the ``Colors``(our enum) variants, return a ``Colour``(ansi_term's enum) variant and bind it to a variale named ``color_matched``.

First, create a new instance of ``Args``. To access to its field (``quote`` and ``color``) we need to use the **dot notation**:

```Rust
// ...
let args = Args::parse();
// to access to the quote:
args.quote
// to access to the color:
args.color // If you want to show through terminal remember using ":?"
```

Now we are up to handle:

```Rust
// ...
    let color_matched = match args.color {
        Colors::Red => Colour::Red,
        Colors::Green => Colour::Green,
        Colors::Yellow => Colour::Yellow,
        Colors::Blue => Colour::Blue,
        Colors::Purple => Colour::Purple,
        Colors::Cyan => Colour::Cyan,
        Colors::White => Colour::White,
    };
    println!("The user picked the color {:?}", color_matched);
```

Last thing to do is return the tuple:

```Rust
//...
(args.quote, color_matched)
```

Time to test it!

```bash
cargo build
target/debug/ferris_say.exe -h
ferris-say 0.1.0
cowsay rusty version
USAGE:
    ferris_say.exe --quote <QUOTE> <COLOR>
ARGS:
    <COLOR>    Colors to choose [possible values: red, green, yellow, blue, purple,
               cyan, white]
OPTIONS:
    -h, --help             Print help information
    -q, --quote <QUOTE>    Quote that ferris will say
    -V, --version          Print version information
```

passing the ``-h`` or ``--help`` shows the arguments we can use.

Once we know what are the arguments, we're able to use it correctly.

```bash
target/debug/ferris_say.exe -q "Hello world!" red
The user picked the color Red
```

But...what if I pass a color that isn't valid?

```bash
target/debug/ferris_say.exe -q "hello world!" black
error: "black" isn't a valid value for '<COLOR>'
        [possible values: red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan, white]
USAGE:
    ferris_say.exe --quote <QUOTE> <COLOR>
For more information try --help
```
We are ready to go to the next step: drawing the ferris.
## Draw the ferris
Here, I highly recommend you just to copy and paste the drawing. But first, let's create another function ``draw``:
### The function signature
```Rust
fn draw(quote: &str, color: &Colour)
```
Inside the ``draw`` function:
```Rust
// Ferris drawing
    const FERRIS: &'static str = r"
    .
     .
      .
       █ █           █ █
        ▀█  ▄█████▄  █▀
         ▀▄███▀█▀███▄▀ 
         ▄▀███▀▀▀███▀▄ 
         █ ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄ █
    ";
    println!("{}", format!("\"{}\"{}", quote, color.paint(FERRIS)));
```
A ``r""`` String is called as "raw string", in short, it tells the compiler to ignore every scape character, It's easier for us to draw our ferris that way. On the other hand we have a ``format!``macro, we use it as we'll place the text right above the ferris. It will be better illustrated as we run the program.
**Last but not least** color is a Colour instance passed by reference, that means we can use the ``paint`` that receives a &str params. It "paints" the text to a given color.
Finally inside our ``main function``:
```Rust
fn main() {
    let (q, c) = input();
    draw(&q, &c)
}
```
## Final code
We'll split it into parts to understand how it works.
```Rust
use ansi_term::{self, Colour}; // 0.12.1
use clap::{ArgEnum, Parser};
fn draw(quote: &str, color: &Colour) {
    // Ferris drawing
    const FERRIS: &'static str = r"
    .
     .
      .
       █ █           █ █
        ▀█  ▄█████▄  █▀
         ▀▄███▀█▀███▄▀ 
         ▄▀███▀▀▀███▀▄ 
         █ ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄ █
    ";
    println!("{}", format!("\"{}\"{}", quote, color.paint(FERRIS)));
}
fn input()-> (String, Colour) {
    #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
    #[clap(author, version, about = "cowsay rusty version")]
    struct Args {
        /// Quote that ferris will say
        #[clap(short, long)]
        quote: String,
        /// Colors to choose
        #[clap(arg_enum)]
        color: Colors,
    }
    #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, ArgEnum, Debug)]
    enum Colors {
        // Not black because it's the our background color
        Red,
        Green,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
        Purple,
        Cyan,
        White,
    }
    let args = Args::parse();
    // validate colors argument:
    let color_matched = match args.color {
        Colors::Red => Colour::Red,
        Colors::Green => Colour::Green,
        Colors::Yellow => Colour::Yellow,
        Colors::Blue => Colour::Blue,
        Colors::Purple => Colour::Purple,
        Colors::Cyan => Colour::Cyan,
        Colors::White => Colour::White,
    };
    (args.quote, color_matched)
}
fn main() {
    let (q, c) = input();
    draw(&q, &c)
}
```
